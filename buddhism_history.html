        <h1>Sikkim & The Sacred Land of Rice</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #666;">The history of Sikkim is intrinsically linked to the spread and establishment of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>

        <h2>The Founding of Sikkim and the Chogyal Dynasty</h2>
        
        <p>
            The history of modern Sikkim begins in the 17th century. The region was consecrated as a sacred land (**Beyul**) long before by the great tantric master **Guru Padmasambhava** (Guru Rimpoche) in the 8th century. He prophesied the rule of the Chogyals.
        </p>
        <p>
            In **1642**, three venerable Tibetan Lamas—Lhatsun Chempo, Rigzin Chempo, and Kathok Chempo—met at **Yuksam** (West Sikkim). They crowned the first temporal and spiritual king (**Chogyal**), **Phuntsog Namgyal**, marking the formal foundation of the Chogyal Dynasty and the Kingdom of Sikkim. The dynasty ruled peacefully for over 330 years until 1975, with its lineage traced back to Tibet.
        </p>

        <h2>Tibetan Buddhism in Sikkim</h2>
        
        <p>
            Sikkim is unique in its devotion to the older schools of Tibetan Buddhism, primarily the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions. The monasteries established by the founding lamas, such as Pemayangtse and Tashiding, remain the most spiritually significant sites in the entire region. The entire territory is considered a **Dharma Chakra** (Wheel of Law).
        </p>

        <p>
            The monasteries are centers of learning, housing ancient manuscripts, conducting rituals (Chaam dances), and preserving the unique cultural synthesis of the Lepcha, Bhutia, and Nepali communities.
        </p>

        <h3>Significance of the Chogyal Rule</h3>
        <p>
            The Chogyal dynasty was crucial as it maintained Sikkim's status as a **Dharmaraja** (a kingdom ruled by religious law). The Chogyal served as both the head of state and the spiritual leader, ensuring that the law and customs were aligned with Buddhist principles of compassion and non-violence. Their rule protected the monasteries and the Buddhist heritage, allowing the sacred traditions to flourish even as the political landscape shifted around the Himalayas.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Four Schools of Tibetan Buddhism</h2>
        <p>
            While Sikkim is primarily dominated by the Nyingma and Kagyu sects, all four major schools originate from the revival of Buddhism in Tibet after the 10th century.
        </p>

        <ul class="school-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Nyingma (The Ancient Ones):</strong> The oldest school, directly descended from the translations of the first wave of Buddhism introduced by Guru Padmasambhava in the 8th century. It emphasizes Dzogchen (Great Perfection). Many Sikkim monasteries, like **Pemayangtse** and **Dubdi**, belong to this sect.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Kagyu (Oral Lineage):</strong> This school emphasizes meditation and a strong lineage of oral instructions and practical experience. Famous for the Karmapas, whose traditional seat in India is **Rumtek Monastery** (East Sikkim).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gelug (The Virtuous Way):</strong> The newest and largest school, founded by Je Tsongkhapa. Known for its distinct yellow hats and strict monastic discipline. The **Dalai Lama** belongs to this tradition. This sect is less dominant in Sikkim but highly influential globally.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sakya (Grey Earth):</strong> Named after the region in Tibet where it originated. It is known for its scholarly traditions and the path of Lamdre (the Path and its Fruit), emphasizing comprehensive learning.
